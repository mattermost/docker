# Mattermost Docker setup

This repository is meant to replace the previous *mattermost-docker* repository and tries to stay as close as possible
to the old one. Migrating will include some steps described below. To keep it
simple all the basic configuration can be done through the *.env* file and you're free to change it to your likings.
Additional guides can be found in the *docs* folder. Those are **optional**.
It's advised to take a look at our [documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/scaling.html) with regards to
scalability.

## Prequisites
1. A Docker installation is needed (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Docker-compose needs to be >= 1.28 (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Quick setup
These steps are required for new Mattermost setups and don't include everything needed when already using
*mattermost-docker*.

### 1. Cloning the repository (as an alternative please download it as archive)
```
git clone https://github.com/mattermost/docker
cd docker
```

### 2. Create a *.env* file by copying and adjusting the env.example file
Docker will search for an *.env* file when no option specifies another environment file. Afterwards edit it with your preferred text editor.
```
cp env.example .env
```

Within the .env file make sure you edit at a minimum the below values. You can find a list of the Mattermost version tags here: [enterprise-edition](https://hub.docker.com/r/mattermost/mattermost-enterprise-edition/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) / [team-edition](https://hub.docker.com/r/mattermost/mattermost-team-edition/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated). If you want to change the postgres user and pass, you will do so in this `.env` file as well.

```
## This domain must be a live domain (FQDN) that points to the server where Mattermost is installed.
DOMAIN=mm.example.com

## This will be 'mattermost-enterprise-edition' or 'mattermost-team-edition' based on the version of Mattermost you're installing.
MATTERMOST_IMAGE=mattermost-enterprise-edition
MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG=5.36
```


### 3. Create the needed directores and set permissions (this orientates on the previous *mattermost-docker* structure and the direcories can be changed in the *.env* file)
```
mkdir -p ./volumes/app/mattermost/{config,data,logs,plugins,client/plugins}
sudo chown -R 2000:2000 ./volumes/app/mattermost
```

### 4. Enable Docker
First ensure the docker daemon is enabled and running:
```
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

### 5. Placing the certificate and key (if using provided nginx)
Use either 5.1 or 5.2 for setting up SSL. Both methods require you to change the path to the Let's Encrypt config folders inside the *.env*. 


#### 5.1 Pre-existing certificate and key
```
## When using the provided nginx and if a certificate and key already exists make the below directory
mkdir -p ./volumes/web/cert

## Then copy your existing certs into this directory.
cp PATH-TO-CERT.PEM ./volumes/web/cert/cert.pem
cp PATH-TO-KEY.PEM ./volumes/web/cert/key-no-password.pem
```
#### 5.2 Configure SSO with GitLab
If you are looking for SSO with GitLab and you use self signed certificate you have to add the PKI chain of your authority in app because Alpine doesn't know him. This is required to avoid **Token request failed: certificate signed by unknown authority**

For that uncomment this line :
```
# - ${GITLAB_PKI_CHAIN_PATH}:/etc/ssl/certs/pki_chain.pem:ro
```

#### 5.3 Let's Encrypt
For using Let's Encrypt you can use this Bash script located in scripts/issue-certificate.sh (or follow the steps in docs/issuing-letsencrypt-certificate.md). Make sure to adjust `mm.example.com` to match your domain configured in step 2.
```
bash scripts/issue-certificate.sh -d mm.example.com -o ${PWD}/certs
```
Otherwise please consult the Certbot [documentation](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions) on how to issue a standalone certificate and ensure the paths to the certificate and key are correctly set in your *.env*.

#### 5.4 Adjusting the `.env` file.
Once you've completed 5.1 or 5.2 or 5.3 you'll need to adjust the `.env` file accordingly. With 5.1 verify the first two lines below are uncommented in the `.env` file, with 5.2 uncomment the third line and put the correct path for your pki chain, with 5.3 comment out the first two lines and uncomment the last two lines.

```
CERT_PATH=./volumes/web/cert/cert.pem
KEY_PATH=./volumes/web/cert/key-no-password.pem
#GITLAB_PKI_CHAIN_PATH=<path_to_your_gitlab_pki>/pki_chain.pem
#CERT_PATH=./certs/etc/letsencrypt/live/${DOMAIN}/fullchain.pem
#KEY_PATH=./certs/etc/letsencrypt/live/${DOMAIN}/privkey.pem
```

### 6. Run `docker-compose`
Choose if you're running this docker image with NGINX or using your own proxy.

#### 6.1 Default (with nginx)
```
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.nginx.yml up -d
```

#### 6.2. Without nginx (for use behind an existing reverse proxy)
```
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.without-nginx.yml up -d
```

# Update Mattermost to the latest version
To update Mattermost to the latest version in this repo run the below commands. This will download a new image of the instance and update Mattermost.

```
## Based on what you followed in step 6
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.nginx.yml down
# OR
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.without-nginx.yml down

git pull  ## alternatively you can change the docker tag yourself as described below

sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.nginx.yml up -d
## OR
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.without-nginx.yml up -d
```

# Installing different versions of Mattermost
If you want to have a different version of Mattermost installed you will need to follow the below steps:

1. Open the `.env` file in your docker folder
2. Edit the line `MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG=5.34` to be equal to the version you want. Ex: (`MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG=5.35`).
  - You can find a list of the Mattermost version tags here: [enterprise-edition](https://hub.docker.com/r/mattermost/mattermost-enterprise-edition/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) / [team-edition](https://hub.docker.com/r/mattermost/mattermost-team-edition/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated).
3. `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.nginx.yml down` or `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.without-nginx.yml down`
4. `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.nginx.yml up -d` or `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.without-nginx.yml up -d`

# Removing The Docker Containers
Remove the containers

```
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.nginx.yml down
# OR
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.without-nginx.yml down
```

Remove all the data and settings of your Mattermost instance
```
sudo rm -rf volumes
```

# Upgrading from mattermost-docker

For upgrading from deprecated [mattermost-docker](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker) please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/mattermost/docker/blob/main/scripts/UPGRADE.md). 
This will upgrade the mattermost-docker postgres database and the mattermost application. The upgrade script aims to ease the migration to this repository's approach which does not use customized docker images. 
This repository will be maintained for future releases.  

For any comments, help needed and/or questions, please don't hesitate to write us in this issue: https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker/issues/489
